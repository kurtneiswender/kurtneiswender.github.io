## Residential Lake Home Remodel and Addition for Aging in Place

Urban Colab Architecture was hired by a couple that owned two homes and was looking toward retiring into one of them and requested a renovation that would make the home livable past retirement, a concept that is called ["Aging in Place"](https://www.architectmagazine.com/practice/designing-and-building-for-aging-in-place_o). Another term for this is ["Universal Design"](https://architizer.com/blog/inspiration/industry/universal-design-inclusive-architecture/), and some key attributes of Universal Design, or Aging in Place are fewer and straighter corridors, larger more spacious bathroom, and providing a complete set of residential amenities on a single level of a home. 

For example, if a home has two, or more stories, then the redesign should include, living, sleeping, laundry, cooking, and outdoor spaces all on one level, for the years where the homeowner is no longer capable of using stairs.
