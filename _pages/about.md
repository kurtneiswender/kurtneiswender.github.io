# The End of Disposability 
Urban Colab Architecture intends for all projects to be considerate of the ecological impact of their designed solution. Urban Colab Architecture provides solutions that are architectural in nature (i.e. buildings, infrastructure, fabrications, installations), and ecological in nature (i.e. landscapes, gardens, water storage, regenerative property maintenance). The resulting successful project will provide the client with a resilient property that produces more than it consumes. Both the architectural and ecological designs aim to achieve the highest levels of sustainability in their materials and the environmental impact.
# Our Clients
Our ideal clients are individuals and families that understand the basic principles of self-sufficient living as a whole picture of economic, social, environmental, and energy conservation. We want our purpose to align with our clients goals of living more resilient and with the comfort and capacity of weathering any man-made or natural disaster. Seth Godin speaks about “finding your tribe”, a collection of 1,000 follwers that would buy anything you sell, Urban Colab Architecture will be successful if we find a “tribe” of 100 clients/projects. This target is based on not compromising the solution for anything. Not budget, not schedule, not anything. The sole purpose is to see our clients living their healthiest and happiest life enjoying productive landscapes with renewable resources. 
We provide creative solutions by actively listening to our clients needs. Our end goal is for clients to feel that they were an equal participant in bringing their project to reality. We will guide the process the entire time to act as your “guardrails” giving you an equal stake in the success of your project.
# Our Mission
People first, profit second. We provide design services and products that are directly focused on low-to-no energy consumption. We also extend this focus to developing site and landscape design that equally serves to reduce environmental impact. Combining the experience of our founders, Kurt and Danielle, we have a proven track record of creating residential and small commercial projects that go beyond net zero energy consumption but are actually producing energy and food. Urban Colab Architecture is intentionally registered as an L3C.
# Our Purpose
Urban Colab Architecture fundamental purpose is to empower our clients to achieve independent and sustainable lives by designing productive buildings and landscapes. We believe in the thought that “we cannot control the world but we can control how we act in the world”. Our focus is to pursue projects that are truly regenerative and productive. A regenerative solution repairs the impacts made by man. Our projects are intended to engage the landscape with respect to site and place and are designed to operate with minimal utility reliance. Our landscapes are carefully selected to match each site’s unique microclimate for maximum production without wasting resources like water and soil.

# Our Structure
Urban Colab Architecture will be established as a limited liability company (LLC) or a low-profit limited liability company (L3C). L3C’s combine aspects of a nonprofit and for-profit organizations. It is a relatively new innovation in the United States. Its purpose is to attract capital to commercial ventures that promote some sort of social good. The L3C’s primary purpose is a charitable mission while generating profits is a secondary goal.
Urban Colab Architecture will maintain no permanent physical office. Core management staff will operate a home office and collaborate with staff and consultants in remote work methodology. Urban Colab Architecture will obtain a membership to local coworking maker space, Factory Two in Flint, Michigan. This coworking space will be used for face-to-face meetings as needed. The coworking membership will also be used for explorations in design by leveraging the variety of tools provided by the maker space shop.
