I have decided to rebuild the website for my business, Urban Colab Architecture. I am and have long been a fan of the "Do-It-Yourself" attitude, and in this day and age there is a ton of technology to take advantage of to keep things "in-house", that is if you are willing to take the time to learn a few new things and fail... often. 

Not everything is about money but when you are a new business I feel more comfortable to minimize the overhead as much as possible. So I have embarked on a journey to build my own website using a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a static website building tool that uses markdown language formatting. I have become a fan of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) since I started using tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). The difference is that the input of all the web content is pure Markdown as opposed to the "/" command prompt you can use in Notion, so there is a bit of a learning curve to using the core input formats rather than relying on the "/". 

I will be documenting this process through the blog page of my website in addition to showcasing the architecture related parts of my business. I am enjoying the process and have some interesting ideas about [knowledge sharing](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up) on my website so that it becomes a hub for all of my professional endeavors.
