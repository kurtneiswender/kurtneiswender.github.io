I decided to take it upon myself to rewrite my website from scratch to accomplish a few things. 

The first is to host for free on github pages and get away from bluehost and wordpress, not that either are bad, just that I want to do somethings that I think will be difficult in wordpress environment and also see if can't save some money.
